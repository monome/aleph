aleph.

1. processor/synth. sound/audio computer.
2. expansive i/o. connected.
3. modular operating system. dynamic control patching.
4. open source.



a music computer. open source noise device.


+ dynamic program. 
	echo, synth, filter, drum machine, etc.
	open source = user designed, community driven
	sdcard

+ flexible interface
	four encoders, four keys, two footswitch
	CV input and output, 10V
	screen
	usb device = computer communication
	usb host
		hid midi = keyboard, knob box, drum pad, MIDI ports
		monomes
	inter-device communication = i2c (needs a name?)

+ adaptable interaction.
	complex or simple program interface
	assignable parameter mapping
	parameter transformation, automation, sequencing
	preset
	
+ audio
	high fidelity audio i/o
	gain stages with LED meters
	quad outputs and inputs
		individual outs for drum/synth/loop voices
		analog inserts


video:

1. viola and mic input, echo patch, foot pedals, analog insert path (filter?)
2. eurorack and gamepad, bees sequencer or something
3. aleph with usb midi keyboard playing polyphonic synth
4. monome grid with aleph drum machine

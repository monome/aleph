* \section intro Introduction
* This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables, defines, enums, and
* typedefs for the power manager driver.\n It also gives an example of the usage of the
* PM on UC3 products.
* This example shows how to configure the Power Manager(PM) and the
* System Control Interface(SCIF) (only for devices that include a SCIF module) to
* use Oscillator 0 as source of main clock and configure a generic clock GCLK with
* this OSC0 as input. The generic clock 0 can be then viewed on the GCLK pin (this
* is the oscillator 0 frequency). Once these configurations are done, the example
* goes into sleep mode while still maintaining GCLK output.
*
* \section compinfo Compilation Info
* This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
* for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
*
* \section deviceinfo Device Info
* All AVR32 devices with a PM module or AVR32 devices with a PM module and a SCIF
* module can be used. This example has been tested with the following setup:\n
* - EVK1100 evaluation kit
* - EVK1101 evaluation kit
* - EVK1104 evaluation kit
* - STK600 starter kit with the RCUC3L0 routing card
* - STK600 starter kit with the RCUC3D routing card
* - UC3C_EK evaluation kit
*
* \section setupinfo Setup Information
* \n CPU speed: <i>OSC0 MHz</i>\n\n
* On EVK1100, GCLK_0_1 is pin number 51 (PB19) with AT32UC3A0512 in QFP144 package.
* - Check GCLK0 pin with an oscilloscope, this is OSC0 frequency (12MHz).
*
* On EVK1101, GCLK_2 is pin number 30 (PA30) with AT32UCB0256 in QFP64 package.
* - Check GCLK2 pin with an oscilloscope, this is OSC0 frequency (12MHz).
*
* On EVK1104, GCLK_1_0 is pin number 43 (PB11) with AT32UC3A3256 in QFP144 package.
* - Check GCLK1 pin with an oscilloscope, this is OSC0 frequency (12MHz).
*
* On the STK600 + RCUC3L0 setup, insert a 12MHz crystal in the STK600 crystal socket.
* GCLK_1_0 is GPIO pin 6/pin pa06/pin#10 on a UC3L QFP48 package; for the RCUC3L0
* routing card, this pin is mapped on STK600.PORTA.PA6.
* - Check the GCLK1 pin with an oscilloscope, it should oscillate at the crystal frequency (12MHz).
*
* On the STK600 + RCUC3D setup, insert a 12MHz crystal in the STK600 crystal socket.
* GCLK0 is GPIO pin 3/pin pa03/pin#7 on a UC3D QFP64 package; for the RCUC3D routing card,
* this pin is mapped on STK600.PORTA.PA3.
* - Check the GCLK1 pin with an oscilloscope, it should oscillate at the crystal frequency (12MHz).
*
* On UC3C_EK, GCLK_0_2 is pin number 54 (PB22) with AT32UC3C0512C in QFP144 package.
* - Check GCLK1 pin with an oscilloscope, this is OSC0 frequency (16MHz).

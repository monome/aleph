 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables, defines, enums, and
 * typedefs for the power manager driver. <BR>It also gives an example of the usage of the
 * PM on UC3 products.
 * <BR>This example shows:
 * - how to configure a PLL (or a DFLL, depending on the device) and use it as the main clock source for the synchronous clocks,
 * - configure a Generic Clock and output it to a GPIO pin,
 * - LED0 blinks endlessly.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
 * for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR32 devices can be used. This example has been tested with the following setups:<BR>
 * <ul><li>EVK1100 evaluation kit
 * <li>EVK1105 evaluation kit
 * <li>EVK1101 evaluation kit
 * <li>EVK1104 evaluation kit
 * <li>STK600 starter kit with the RCUC3L0 routing card
 * <li>AT32UC3L-EK evaluation kit
 * <li>AT32UC3C-EK evaluation kit
 * <li>STK600 starter kit with the RCUC3D routing card</ul>
 *
 * \section setupinfo Setup Information
 * CPU speed: <i> 48 MHz </i>
 * - On \b EVK1100, check GCLK0 pin with an oscilloscope, the frequency should be 48MHz.
 * On EVK1100, GCLK_0 is pin number 51 (PB19) with AT32UC3A0512 in QFP144 package.
 * Since LED5 is also on PB19, you should also see LED5 turn red.
 * - On \b EVK1105, check GCLK2 pin with an oscilloscope, the frequency should be 48MHz.
 * On EVK1100, GCLK_2 is pin number 62 (PB30) with AT32UC3A0512 in QFP144 package.
 * This pin is accessible on J16.6 on EVK1105 revB or on J17.5 on EVK1105 revC.
 * - On \b EVK1101, check GCLK2 pin with an oscilloscope, the frequency should be 48MHz.
 * On EVK1101, GCLK_2 is pin number 30 (PA30) with AT32UC3B0256 in QFP64 package.
 * - On \b EVK1104, check GCLK1 pin with an oscilloscope, the frequency should be 48MHz.
 * On EVK1104, GCLK_1 is pin number 43 (PB11) with AT32UC3A3256 in QFP144 package.
 * - On the \b STK600 + \b RCUC3L0 setup or on the AT32UC3L-EK board, check
 * the GCLK_1_0 pin with an oscilloscope, the frequency should be 48MHz.
 * GCLK_1_0 is GPIO pin 6/pin pa06/pin#10 on a UC3L QFP48 package; for the RCUC3L0
 * routing card, this pin is mapped on STK600.PORTA.PA6; for the AT32UC3L-EK board,
 * place the oscilloscope probe on connector PA6.
 * - On \b UC3C_EK, check GCLK0 pin with an oscilloscope, the frequency should be 48MHz.
 * On UC3C_EK, GCLK_0 is pin number 54 (PB22) with AT32UC3C0512C in QFP144 package.
 * - On the \b STK600 + \b RCUC3D setup , check the GCLK_0 pin with an oscilloscope,
 * the frequency should be 36MHz. GCLK_0 is GPIO pin 3/pin pa03.
 * For the RCUC3D routing card, this pin is mapped on STK600.PORTA.PA3.
 * - Check that LED0 blinks (whatever the board).

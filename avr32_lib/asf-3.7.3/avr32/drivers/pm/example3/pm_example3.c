 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables, defines, enums, and
 * typedefs for the power manager driver. <BR>It also gives an example of the usage of the
 * PM on UC3 products.
 * <BR>This example shows:
 * - how to configure the RC120M oscillator and use it as the main clock source for the synchronous clocks,
 * - configure a Generic Clock and output it to a GPIO pin,
 * - LED0 blinks endlessly.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
 * for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR32 devices can be used. This example has been tested with the following setups:<BR>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>AT32UC3L-EK evaluation kit</li>
 *     <li>STK600 starter kit with the RCUC3D routing card</ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * \section setupinfo Setup Information
 * CPU speed: <i> 30 MHz </i>
 * - On the AT32UC3L-EK board, check the GCLK_1_0 pin with an oscilloscope, the
 * frequency should be 30MHz. GCLK_1_0 is GPIO pin 6/pin PA06/pin#10 on a UC3L
 * - On the \b STK600 + \b RCUC3D setup , check the GCLK_0 pin with an oscilloscope,
 * the frequency should be 30MHz. GCLK_0 is GPIO pin 3/pin PA03.
 * QFP48 package;
 * - Check that LED0 blinks endlessly.

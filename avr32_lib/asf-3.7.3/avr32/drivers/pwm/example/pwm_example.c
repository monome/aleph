/** \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 *defines, enums, and
 * typedefs for the PWM driver. <BR>It also gives an example of the usage of the
 * PWM on UC3 products.
 * This example shows how to configure a PWM and output it on a GPIO.\n
 * <b>Operating mode</b>:\n Check the used PWM pin with an oscilloscope, you
 * should see a PWM frequency of 22.5 Hz with a PWM duty cycle of 3/4.\n
 * - On \b EVK1100, PWM3 is pin number 54 (PB22) with AT32UC3A0512 in QFP144
 *   package. Also, LED7 is connected to PB22. Thus, you should also see LED7
 *   blink.
 * - On \b EVK1101, PWM0 is pin number 13 (PA07) with AT32UC3B0256 in QFP64
 *   package. Also, LED0 is connected to PA07. Thus, you should also see it
 *   blink.
 * - On \b EVK1105, PWM4 is pin number 59 (PB27) with AT32UC3A0512 in QFP144
 *   package. Also, LED0 is connected to PB27. Thus, you should also see it
 *   blink.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
 * for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR32 devices with a PWM module can be used. This example has been tested
 * with the following setup:\n
 * - EVK1100 evaluation kit
 * - EVK1101 evaluation kit
 * - EVK1105 evaluation kit
 *
 * \section setupinfo Setup Information
 * CPU speed: <i>Internal RC oscillator (about 115200 Hz)</i>.
 *

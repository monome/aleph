 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the TWI driver single-master mode example.
 *
 * The given example uses one evaluation kit for TWI master (EVK1100, EVK1101 or
 * STK1000) and another one for TWI slave (EVK1100 or EVK1101 to program with
 * SLAVE_EXAMPLE).\n
 * The TWI master performs a few basic checks and prints the results (PASS/FAIL)
 * on USART1. The checks are:
 *    - the TWI master probes the TWI slave,
 *    - the TWI master performs a write access to the TWI slave,
 *    - the TWI master performs a read access of what it just wrote to the TWI slave,
 *    - the read data are compared with the originally written data.
 *
 * \section validationprocedure Validation Procedure
 * - Connect a UART monitor on the UART_1 of the board with TWI master
 * - Connect the TWI master with TWI slave (VCC=VCC,SDA=SDA,SCL=SCL,GND=GND)
 * - Compile a master and a slave firmware with same configuration (addr mode,speed)
 * - Program the master and slave boards
 * - RESET Slave board (=reset TWI memory)
 * - Release RESET on MASTER board
 * - on UART, you see all tests PASS
 * - Release RESET on MASTER board
 * - on UART, you see always all tests PASS.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - twi.c: TWI driver;
 * - twi.h: TWI driver header file;
 * - twi_master_example.c: TWI single-master mode example application.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software is written for GNU GCC for AVR32 and for IAR Embedded Workbench
 * for Atmel AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * You can change the following defines but you should make sure that there are
 * the same on the TWI slave side for the tests to pass:
 * - TWI slave (memory) address (\ref EEPROM_ADDRESS)
 * - Address of the virtual mem in the EEPROM (\ref VIRTUALMEM_ADDR_START)
 * - Address length of the EEPROM memory (\ref EEPROM_ADDR_LGT)
 * - speed in Hz (\ref TWI_SPEED).
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR32 devices with a TWI module can be used.
 *
 * \section configinfo Configuration Information
 * This example has been tested with the following configuration:
 * - EVK1100 or EVK1101 evaluation kit, or STK1000 starter kit;
 * - CPU clock: 12 MHz;
 * - USART1 connected to a PC serial port via a standard RS232 DB9 cable;
 * - PC terminal settings:
 *   - 57600 bps,
 *   - 8 data bits,
 *   - no parity bit,
 *   - 1 stop bit,
 *   - no flow control.

 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the EIC driver. This documentation is also
 * bundled with an example.
 *
 * This example shows how to use an external interrupt to wake up the
 * cpu when in sleep mode (static). \n
 * <b>Operating mode:</b>
 * -# At the beginning, the CPU is set in the <b>Static</b> sleep mode.
 * -# To leave the sleep mode, the user needs :
 *    - Press the Joystick on EVK1100
 *    - Press the pushbutton PB0 on EVK1101
 *    - Set PA20 low on EVK1104
 *    - Set PA29 low (press button PB1) on UC3C_EK
 *    - Set PA09 low on AT32UC3L-EK.
 *    - Press SWITCHES.SW0 (setup can be found in conf_example1)
 * In normal mode (i.e. out of the sleep mode), the led LED0 toggles for a short while;
 * the CPU is then switched back again into the <b>Static</b>
 * sleep mode (back to step 1)...etc
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - eic.c: EIC driver;
 * - eic.h: EIC driver header file;
 * - eic_example1.c: EIC example application.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
 * for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR32 devices with a EIC module can be used. This example has been tested
 * with the following setup:<BR>

 *  <li>EVK1104 evaluation kit
 *  <li>UC3C_EK evaluation kit
 *  <li>STK600+RCUCD routing card;

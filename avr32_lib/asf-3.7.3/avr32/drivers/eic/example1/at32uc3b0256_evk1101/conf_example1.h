/*
 * With the UC3B datasheet, in section "Peripheral Multiplexing on I/O lines" in
 * the table "GPIO Controller Function Multiplexing", we see that the External
 * Interrupt 6 is mapped on GPIO 34 (i.e. PB02). Using the EVK1101 schematics,
 * we see that the pushbutton PB2 press event is connected to PB02. Thus, a press
 * on PB2 will generate the external interrupt 6.
 * Note: AVR32_EIC_EXTINT_6_PIN & AVR32_EIC_EXTINT_6_FUNCTION defines are found
 * in the uc3bxxxx.h part-specific header file.

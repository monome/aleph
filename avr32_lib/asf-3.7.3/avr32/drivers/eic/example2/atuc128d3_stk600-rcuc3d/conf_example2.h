/*
 * With the UC3D datasheet, in section "Peripheral Multiplexing on I/O lines"
 * in the table "GPIO Controller Function Multiplexing", we see that the NMI is
 * mapped on GPIO 13 (i.e. PA13). On the STK600 using the RCUC3D, it is require
 * to connect PORTB.PB5 on SWITCHES.SW0. Thus, a low level on SW01 will generate
 * an NMI. The External Interrupt number 0 is the NMI. It is also required to
 * connect PORTA.PA to LEDS.LEDS0

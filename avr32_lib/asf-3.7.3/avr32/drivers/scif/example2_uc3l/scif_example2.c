/*! \mainpage
* \section intro Introduction
* This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables, defines,
* enums, and typedefs for the SCIF driver.\n It also gives an example of usage of
* the SCIF & PM module on UC3 products.
* This example shows how to configure the System Control Interface(SCIF) to:
* - generate a high frequency clock (~24MHz) with a DFLL in closed-loop mode,
* - switch the main clock source to the DFLL and set the clock domains to 12MHz (use of the PM module),
* - set-up a generic clock at 12MHz with the DFLL as a source,
* - output the generic clock to a pin.
* At the end of the example, using the Power manager(PM), the program goes into
* the frozen sleep mode (while still maintaining GCLK output to the pin).
*
* \section compinfo Compilation Info
* This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
* for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
*
* \section deviceinfo Device Info
* All AVR32 devices with a PM module and a SCIF module can be used. This example
* has been tested with the following setup:\n
* - STK600 starter kit with the RCUC3L0 routing card
* - AT32UC3L-EK board
*
* \section setupinfo Setup Information
* \n CPU speed: <i>115 kHz</i>\n\n
* On the STK600 + RCUC3L0 setup and also on the AT32UC3L-EK setup, the generic
* clock is output to the GCLK_1_0 pin. This is the GPIO pin 6/pin pa06/pin#10 on
* a UC3L QFP48 package. For the RCUC3L0 routing card, this pin is mapped on STK600.PORTA.PA6.
* - Check the GCLK1_0 pin with an oscilloscope, it oscillates at the frequency 12MHz.
*

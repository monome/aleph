/**
 * \mainpage
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * This demo application is a simple example demonstrating the basic use of the
 * AVR32 UC3 USART driver on a range of Atmel hardware.
 *
 * <b>Example's operating mode:</b>
 * -# A message is displayed on the PC terminal ("Hello, this is AT32UC3 saying
 *    hello! (press enter)")
 * -# You may then type any character other than CR(Carriage Return) and it will
 *    be echoed back to the PC terminal.
 * -# If you type a CR, "'CRLF'Goodbye." is echoed back to the PC terminal and
 *    the application ends.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - usart.c: USART driver;
 * - usart.h: USART driver header file;
 * - usart_example2.c: USART example application.
 *
 * \section compilinfo Compilation Information
 * This software is written for GNU GCC for AVR32 and for IAR Embedded
 * Workbench for Atmel AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Information
 * All AVR32 devices with a USART module can be used.
 *
 * \section configinfo Configuration Information
 * This example has been tested with the following configuration:
 * - UC3-L0 Xplained Board
 * - UC3-A3 Xplained Board
 *
 * - PC terminal settings:
 *   - 57600 bps,
 *   - 8 data bits,
 *   - no parity bit,
 *   - 1 stop bit,
 *   - no flow control.

/** \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the GPIO driver.
 *
 * The General Purpose Input/Output manages the I/O pins of the microcontroller.
 * Each I/O line
 * may be dedicated as a general-purpose I/O or be assigned to a function of an
 * embedded peripheral.
 * This assures effective optimization of the pins of a product.
 *
 * The given example covers various uses of the GPIO controller and demonstrates
 * different GPIO functionalities using the peripheral bus interface. It uses a
 * LED and a button.
 *
 * This interface operates with lower clock frequencies (fPB <= fCPU), and its
 * timing is not deterministic since it needs to access a shared bus which may
 * be heavily loaded.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - gpio.c: GPIO driver;
 * - gpio.h: GPIO driver header file;
 * - gpio_peripheral_bus_example.c: GPIO example application using the
 * peripheral bus.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
 * for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR32 devices with a GPIO module can be used. This example has been
 * tested
 * with the following setup:
 *   - EVK1100, EVK1101, UC3C_EK, EVK1104 or EVK1105 evaluation kits
 *   - STK600+RCUC3L0 routing card connect :
 *            - STK600.PORTA.PA4 to STK600.LEDS.LED0
 *            - STK600.PORTA.PA5 to STK600.LEDS.LED1
 *            - STK600.PORTD.PD2 to STK600.SWITCHES.SW0
 *   - STK600+RCUC3L4 routing card connect :
 *            - STK600.PORTC.PC3 to STK600.LEDS.LED0
 *            - STK600.PORTD.PD7 to STK600.LEDS.LED1
 *            - STK600.PORTD.PD6 to STK600.SWITCHES.SW0
 *     Press and release SW0 to turn LED1 on/off. LED0 is automatically toggled
 *     by the application
 *   - STK600+RCUC3D routing card connect :
 *            - STK600.PORTA.PA4 to STK600.LEDS.LED0
 *            - STK600.PORTA.PA5 to STK600.LEDS.LED1
 *            - STK600.PORTD.PE2 to STK600.SWITCHES.SW0
 *     Press and release SW0 to turn LED1 on/off. LED0 is automatically toggled
 *     by the application
 *   - AT32UC3L-EK: the A LED toggles forever and use the WAKE button to toggle
 *     the B LED.

 * \section intro Introduction
 * This documents data structures, functions, variables, defines, enums, and
 * typedefs in the software for application note AVR32x. It also gives an
 * example of the usage of the SSC driver generating I2S output.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
 * for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR32 devices with an SSC module can be used. This example has been tested
 * with the following setup:
 *
 * \section setupinfo Setup Information
 * CPU speed: <i>12 MHz</i>
 *
 * The SSC bus located on the EVK1100/EVK1101 board must be connected to an Audio Codec.

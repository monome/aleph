/** \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * The Peripheral DMA controller (PDCA) transfers data between on-chip
 * peripheral modules such as USART, SPI, SSC and on- and off-chip memories.
 * Using the PDCA avoids CPU intervention for data transfers, improving the
 * performance of the microcontroller. The PDCA can transfer data from memory to
 * a peripheral or from a peripheral to memory.
 *
 * The given example is a transfer of an ASCII animation stored in internal
 * flash to a USART output. The ASCII animation is divided in two files
 * (ascii_anim1.h and ascii_anim2.h).
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC for AVR32 and IAR Systems compiler
 * for AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - pdca_example.c: PDCA application example
 * - ascii_anim1.h: First part of the animation string definitions
 * - ascii_anim1.h: Second part of the animation string definitions
 * - conf_example.h: Board specific example hardware definitions
 *
 * \section configinfo Configuration Information
 * This example has been tested with the following configuration:
 * - EVK1100, EVK1101, UC3C_EK or EVK1104 or EVK1105 evaluation kit
 * - STK600+RCUC3L routing card
 * - STK600+RCUC3D routing card
 *
 * On EVK1100 or EVK1101 or STK600+RCUC3D: \n
 * Connect USART1 to a PC serial port via a standard RS232 DB9 cable.
 *
 * On UC3C_EK: \n
 * Connect to the PC via the virtual CDC class USB serial port.
 *
 * On STK600+RCUC3L connect STK600.PE2 to STK600.RS232 SPARE.TXD and
 * STK600.PE3 to STK600.RS232 SPARE.RXD, and connect the STK600 to a PC serial
 * port via a standard RS232 DB9 cable.
 *
 * On STK600+RCUC3D connect STK600.PC7 to STK600.RS232 SPARE.TXD and
 * STK600.PD0 to STK600.RS232 SPARE.RXD, and connect the STK600 to a PC serial
 * port via a standard RS232 DB9 cable.
 *
 * - PC terminal settings:
 *   - 57600 bps,
 *   - 8 data bits,
 *   - no parity bit,
 *   - 1 stop bit,
 *   - no flow control.

/**
 * \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the MPU driver.\n It also gives an example
 * of the usage of the MPU module.
 *
 * The MPU allows the user to divide the memory space into different protection
 * regions. These regions have a user-defined size and start at a user-defined
 * address. The different regions can have different access privileges
 * attributes.
 *
 * You can also read the Memory Protection Unit section in the AVR32 UC
 * technical reference guide.
 *
 * \section description Example Description
 * - The memory areas are set up in the following manner:
 * <table>
 * <CAPTION><em>Access permissions of used memory areas</em></CAPTION>
 * <tr>
 *  <td><em> Memory Range </em></td>
 *  <td><em> Access Permissions </em></td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *  <td> RAM   [0x00000000 - 0x00000F00[, Region 1, subregions 0 to 14 </td>
 *  <td> Read / Write </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *  <td> RAM   [0x00000F00 - 0x00001000[, Region 1, subregion 15 </td>
 *  <td> Read </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *  <td> Stack [&stack - &stack + stack size[, Region 2, all subregions </td>
 *  <td> Read / Write </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *  <td> Flash [0x80000000 - 0x8000C000[, Region 0, subregions 0 to 11</td>
 *  <td> Read / eXecute </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *  <td> Flash [0x8000C000 - 0x80010000[, Region 0, subregions 12 to 15 </td>
 *  <td> Read </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *  <td> PBA memory map[0xFFFF0000 - 0xFFFFFFFF], Region 3, all subregions</td>
 *  <td> Read / Write </td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * - The application then performs a write access to Region 1/subregion 15.
 * That triggers a DTLB write protection exception => MPU_STATE changes to
 * DTLB_WRITE_EXCEPTION and LED3 lights up.
 * - The application then calls a function in Region 0/Subregion 12.
 * That triggers an ITLB protection exception => MPU_STATE changes to
 * ITLB_PROTECTION_EXCEPTION and LED2 lights up.
 * - End of example: LED0 & LED1 alternatively blink forever.

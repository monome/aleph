 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the SMC on EBI driver.
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use the SMC on EBI driver with the
 * onboard SMC. It initializes the SMC, do a write access and a read back
 *
 * To use this code in your own application, make a pointer to the base address
 * of the SMC and access it like you would normally access a memory-mapped
 * device.
 *
 * The file "smc_peripheral.h" contains all declarations for Data Bus Width and timing constraints
 * Please refer to the datasheet for specific SMC module of AVR32 UC3 devices constraints.

/**
 * \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the interrupt controller driver. It also
 * comes bundled with a basic application as an example of usage.
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use the INTC driver for the USART RXRDY
 * interrupt.
 *
 * Operating mode: each character typed on the PC terminal is echoed back.
 *
 * \note The IAR built-in event handling mechanism manages interrupt groups but
 * not lines. This example shows how to register an interrupt through the INTC
 * driver, which manages lines. If interrupt request lines do not have to be
 * handled separately within groups, then the IAR built-in event handling
 * mechanism can be used in this way:
 *   - remove the INTC driver files (intc.c and exception.s82) from the IAR
 *     project;
 *   - remove calls to the INTC driver functions (\ref INTC_init_interrupts and
 *     \ref INTC_register_interrupt);
 *   - add <tt>\#pragma handler = \e AVR32_xxxx_IRQ_GROUP, \e int_level</tt>
 *     above the \c __interrupt keyword;
 *   - the IAR project options can be changed to catch unhandled events under
 *     the \e Runtime tab of the <i>General Options</i> item.
 *
 * \warning The IAR built-in event handling mechanism
 *          (<tt>\#pragma exception</tt> and <tt>\#pragma handler</tt>) MUST NOT
 *          be used along with the INTC driver within a project.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 *   - intc.c: interrupt controller driver;
 *   - intc.h: interrupt controller driver header file;
 *   - exception.S: exception and interrupt handlers assembly file for GCC;
 *   - interrupt_usart_example.c: interrupt controller example application.
 *

 * This software is written for GNU GCC for AVR32 and for IAR Embedded Workbench
 * for Atmel AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *

         1AT32UC3L-EK, STK600+RCUCD) or 115200 bps (on STK1000),

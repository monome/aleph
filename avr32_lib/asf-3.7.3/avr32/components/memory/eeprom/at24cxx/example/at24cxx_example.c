/*! \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the AT24CXX driver.
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use the AT24CXX interface.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - at24cxx_example.c: the AT24CXX example
 * - at24cxx.h: the driver interface for the AT24CXX
 *
 * \section compilinfo Compilation Information
 * This software is written for GNU GCC for AVR32 and for IAR Embedded Workbench
 * for Atmel AVR32. Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Information
 * All AVR32 devices with a TWI can be used.
 *
 * \section configinfo Configuration Information
 * This example has been tested with the following configuration:
 * - UC3C-EK
 * - CPU clock: 60 MHz;
 * - USART abstracted with a USB CDC connection to a PC;port via a standard RS232 DB9 cable;
 * - PC terminal settings:
 *   - 57600 bps,
 *   - 8 data bits,
 *   - no parity bit,
 *   - 1 stop bit,
 *   - no flow control.

 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the unit test application for the MT48LC16m16a2tg7 SDRAM component.
 * In essence, it tests that the EBI has been correctly set up by employing test
 * for data integrity issues.
 *
 * \section files Main Files

 * - \ref common_tests.c
 * - \ref conf_test.h
 * - \ref conf_board.h
 * - \ref conf_clock.h
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * All AVR UC3 devices can be used.
 * This example has been tested with the following setup:
 * - evk1100
 * - evk1104
 * - evk1105
 * - uc3c_ek
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.

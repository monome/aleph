 * \section intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the SDRAMC on EBI driver.
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use the SDRAMC on EBI driver with the
 * onboard SDRAM. It initializes the SDRAM, tests it and then returns the number
 * of errors found.
 *
 * To use this code in your own application, make a pointer to the base address
 * of the SDRAM and access it like you would normally access a memory-mapped
 * device.

 * \section compilinfo Compilation Information
 * This software is written for GNU GCC for AVR32 and for IAR Embedded Workbench

 * \section deviceinfo Device Information
 * All AVR32 devices with an SDRAMC and a USART module can be used.
 *
 * \section configinfo Configuration Information
 * This example has been tested with the following configuration:
 * - EVK1100, UC3C_EK, EVK1104 or EVK1105 evaluation kit;
 * - CPU clock:
 *      -- 12 MHz : EVK1100, EVK1104 or EVK1105 evaluation kit;
 *      -- 16 MHz : UC3C_EK evaluation kit;
 * - USART1 (on EVK1100) connected to a PC serial port via a standard RS232 DB9
 *   cable, or USART0 (on EVK1105) or USART1 (on EVK1104) or USART2 (on UC3C_EK)
 *   abstracted with a USB CDC connection to a PC;
 * - PC terminal settings:
 *   - 57600 bps,
 *   - 8 data bits,
 *   - no parity bit,
 *   - 1 stop bit,
 *   - no flow control.

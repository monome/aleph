 * \brief Driver of the CS2200 clocking device chip.
 *
 * The CS2200-CP is an extremely versatile system clocking device that utilizes
 * a programmable phase lock loop. The CS2200-CP is based on an analog PLL
 * architecture comprised of a Delta-Sigma Fractional-N Frequency Synthesizer.
 * This architecture allows for frequency synthesis and clock generation from a
 * stable reference clock.
 *

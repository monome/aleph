//! @brief This function reads one byte from the USB bus
//!
//! If one byte is present in the USB fifo, this byte is returned. If no data
//! is present in the USB fifo, this function waits for USB data.
//!
//! @return uint8_t byte received

//! @return Boolean. true if the firmware can write a new byte to transmit.

//! @brief This function fills the USB transmit buffer with the new data. This buffer
//! is sent if complete. To flush this buffer before waiting full, launch
//! the uart_usb_flush() function.

/**
 * \mainpage SD/MMC/SDIO Card with FatFs Example
 *
 * \section Purpose
 *
 * This example shows how to implement the SD/MMC stack with the FatFS.
 * It will mount the file system and write a file in the card.
 *
 * The example outputs the information through the standard output (stdio).
 * To know the output used on the board, look in the conf_example.h file
 * and connect a terminal to the correct port.
 *
 * \section Usage
 *
 * -# Build the program and download it into the board.
 * -# On the computer, open and configure a terminal application.
 * Refert to conf_example.h file.
 * -# Start the application.
 * -# In the terminal window, the following text should appear:
 *    \code
 *     -- SD/MMC/SDIO Card Example on FatFs --
 *     -- Compiled: xxx xx xxxx xx:xx:xx --
 *     Please plug an SD, MMC or SDIO card in slot.
 *    \endcode

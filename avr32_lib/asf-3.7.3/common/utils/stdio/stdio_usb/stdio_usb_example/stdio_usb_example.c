 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to configure a C-library Standard
 * I/O interface to the ASF common USB Device CDC service. The initialization
 * routines, along with board and clock configuration constants, illustrate how
 * to perform serial I/O via a Communication Device Class (CDC) device protocol
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - stdio_usb_example.c: the example application.
 * - conf_board.h: board configuration
 * - conf_clock.h: board configuration
 * - stdio_usb.h: Common USB CDC Standard I/O Implementation
 * - read.c : System implementation function used by standard library
 * - write.c : System implementation function used by standard library
 *
 * \section example_description Description of the example
 *   - Send message on USB CDC device to a Virtual Com Port.
 *   - Performs echo of any received character

 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to switch between various system clock sources and
 * prescalers at run time.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - clock_example3_xmega.c: clock system example application
 * - conf_board.h: board initialization configuration
 * - conf_clock.h: system clock configuration
 * - conf_example3.h: chip- or board-specific example configuration
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices can be used.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * The clock system is reconfigured every time the user presses a button
 * (\ref NEXT_BUTTON) to use the next clock source and prescaler settings
 * shown in the state diagram below.
 *
 * \par Sequence of clock source and prescaler settings
 * \dot
	digraph clock_example {
		node [shape = doublecircle];
		RC32M [label = "RC32M / (16 * 2 * 2)"];
		node [shape = ellipse];
		RC32M_div [label = "RC32M / (128 * 1 * 1)"];
		RC2M [label = "RC2M / (4 * 4 * 1)"];
		PLL [label = "PLL : (RC2M * 4) / (128 * 1 * 1)"];

		RC32M -> RC32M_div;
		RC32M_div -> RC2M;
		RC2M -> PLL;
		PLL -> RC32M;
	}
 * \enddot
 *
 * Note that the state diagram indicates the prescaling from the clock source to
 * each of the available clock signals: clk_PER4, clk_PER2 and clk_PER +
 * clk_CPU.
 *
 * The clock frequency decreases with each step in the sequence, until it resets
 * to the initial clock setting. A timer/counter (\ref LED_TC,
 * \ref TC_SYSCLK_PORT and \ref TC_SYSCLK_MODULE) is used in PWM mode to blink a
 * LED, thus giving a visual indication of the peripheral clock frequency.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.

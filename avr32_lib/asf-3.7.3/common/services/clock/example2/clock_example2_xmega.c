 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to initialize the clock system and output the
 * CPU clock on a dedicated pin.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - clock_example2_xmega.c: clock system example application
 * - conf_board.h: board initialization configuration
 * - conf_clock.h: system clock configuration
 * - conf_example2.h: chip- or board-specific example configuration
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices can be used.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * Pin 7 (\ref IOPORT_PIN) on a configurable port (\ref CLKOUT_PORT) is used for
 * output of the CPU clock signal.
 *
 * The main system clock source and prescalers are defined in conf_clock.h.
 * The port to output the clock signal on is defined in conf_example2.h.
 *
 * Refer to the \ref clk_group API documentation for further information on the
 * clock configuration, and the \ref port_driver_group API documentation for
 * further information on the pin configuration.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.

 *
 * \note It is only possible to select the port, not the pin: the clock signal
 * will be output on pin 7 of the configured port.

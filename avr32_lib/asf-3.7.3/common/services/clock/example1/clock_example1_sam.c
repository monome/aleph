 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to initialize the clock system and blink a LED
 * at a constant 1 Hz frequency.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - clock_example1_sam.c: clock system example application
 * - conf_board.h: board initialization configuration
 * - conf_clock.h: system clock configuration
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All SAM devices supported by ASF can be used.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * A delay routine is used to time the interval between each toggling of a LED.
 * The duration of the delay routine is computed from the frequency of the
 * configured system clock source.
 *
 * The main system clock source and prescalers, along with any PLL
 * and/or DFLL configuration, if supported, are defined in conf_clock.h.
 * Changing any of the defines -- #CONFIG_SYSCLK_SOURCE,
 * #CONFIG_SYSCLK_CPU_DIV, etc. -- should not change the frequency of the
 * blinking LED.
 *
 * Refer to the \ref clk_group API documentation for further information on the
 * configuration.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for SAM.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.

 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref sleepmgr_group.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - sleepmgr_example_uc3a_uc3b.c: Sleep manager example application
 * - conf_example.h: configuration of I/O pins
 *
 * \section apiinfo Sleep manager API
 * The sleep manager API can be found \ref sleepmgr_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR UC3 A0/A1/A3/A4 and UC3 B series devices can be used.
 * The example has been tested on the EVK1100, EVK1101, EVK1104 and EVK1105
 * boards.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * The device is put to sleep in sleep modes with increasing "depth", and is
 * periodically woken up by the RTC or asynchronously by an external interrupt
 * for the modes which also disable the RTC.
 * The device will remain in ACTIVE mode for approximately 3 seconds after wake-
 * up, before it goes to sleep in the next mode.
 *
 * The RTC overflows after 1 second, and will then wake the device up. If the
 * device remains in sleep (LED turned off), the device has gone into a too
 * deep sleep mode for the RTC to operate. In this case, the user must wake the
 * device up by applying a low-level on the external interrupt pin, e.g., by
 * pushing a button connected to the pin (\ref WAKE_BUTTON_EIC_PIN).
 *
 * A pin (\ref LED_ACTIVITY_STATUS_PIN) with, e.g., a LED connected is driven
 * low when the device is active and driven high when the device is sleeping.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.

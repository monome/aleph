 * This is the common API for TWIs. Additional features are available

 *
 * \section twi_group_platform Platform Dependencies
 *
 * The TWI API is partially chip- or platform-specific. While all
 * platforms provide mostly the same functionality, there are some
 * variations around how different bus types and clock tree structures
 * are handled.
 *
 * The following functions are available on all platforms, but there may
 * be variations in the function signature (i.e. parameters) and
 * behaviour. These functions are typically called by platform-specific
 * parts of drivers, and applications that aren't intended to be
 * portable:
 *   - Master TWI Module initialization
 *   \code status_code_t twi_master_setup(*twi_module_pointer, twi_master_options_t *opt) \endcode
 *   - Enables TWI Module
 *   \code void twi_master_enable(*twi_module_pointer) \endcode
 *   - Disables TWI Module 
 *   \code void twi_master_disable(*twi_module_pointer) \endcode
 *   - Read data from a slave device
 *   \code status_code_t twi_master_read(*twi_module_pointer, twi_package_t *package) \endcode
 *   - Write data from to a slave device 
 *   \code status_code_t twi_master_write(*twi_module_pointer, twi_package_t *package) \endcode

/**
 * \page twi_quickstart Quickstart guide for Common service TWI
 *
 * This is the quickstart guide for the \ref twi_group "Common service TWI",
 * with step-by-step instructions on how to configure and use the driver in a
 * selection of use cases.
 *
 * The use cases contain several code fragments. The code fragments in the
 * steps for setup can be copied into a custom initialization function, while
 * the steps for usage can be copied into, e.g., the main application function.
 *
 * \section twi_basic_use_case Basic use case
 * In the most basic use case, the TWI module is configured for
 * - Master operation
 * - addressing one slave device of the bus at address 0x50
 * - TWI clock of 50kHz
 * - polled read/write handling
 *
 * \section twi_basic_use_case_setup Setup steps
 * \subsection twi_basic_use_case_setup_code Example code
 * Add to your application C-file:
 * \code
 *  void twi_init(void)
 *  {
 *    twi_master_options_t opt = {
 *        .speed = 50000,
 *        .chip  = 0x50
 *    };
 * 
 *    twi_master_setup(&TWIM0, &opt);
 *  }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection twi_basic_use_case_setup_flow Workflow
 * -# Ensure that board_init() has configured selected I/Os for TWI function.
 * -# Ensure that \ref conf_twim.h is present for the driver.
 *   - \note This file is only for the driver and should not be included by the
 * user.
 * -# Define and initialize config structs for TWI module in your TWI initialization
 * function:
 *   - \code 
 * twi_master_options_t opt = {
 *   .speed = 50000,
 *   .chip  = 0x50
 * }; \endcode
 *   - field \ref speed sets the baudrate of the TWI bus 
 *   - field \ref chip sets the address of the slave device you want to communicate with 
 * -# Call twi_master_setup and optionally check its return code
 *   - \note The config structs can be reused for other TWI modules 
 * after this step. Simply reconfigure and write to others modules.
 *
 * \section twi_basic_use_case_usage Usage steps
 * \subsection twi_basic_use_case_usage_code_writing Example code : Writing to a slave device
 * Use in application C-file:
 * \code
 *  const uint8_t test_pattern[] = {0x55,0xA5,0x5A,0x77,0x99};
 * 
 *  twi_package_t packet_write = {
 *    .addr         = EEPROM_MEM_ADDR,      // TWI slave memory address data
 *    .addr_length  = sizeof (uint16_t),    // TWI slave memory address data size
 *    .chip         = EEPROM_BUS_ADDR,      // TWI slave bus address
 *    .buffer       = (void *)test_pattern, // transfer data source buffer
 *    .length       = sizeof(test_pattern)  // transfer data size (bytes)
 *  };
 *  
 *  while (twi_master_write(&TWIM0, &packet_write) != TWI_SUCCESS);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection twi_basic_use_case_usage_flow Workflow
 * -# Prepare the data you want to send to the slave device:
 *   - \code const uint8_t test_pattern[] = {0x55,0xA5,0x5A,0x77,0x99}; \endcode
 * -# Prepare a twi_package_t structure
 *   \code twi_package_t packet_write; \endcode
 * Fill all the fields of the structure :
 *  - addr is the address in the slave device
 *  - addr_length is the size of the address in the slave (support for large TWI memory devices)
 *  - chip sets the 7 bit address of the slave device you want to communicate with 
 *  - buffer is a pointer on the data to write to slave 
 *  - length is the number of data to write
 *
 * -# Finally, call twi_master_write \code twi_master_write(&TWIM0, &packet_write); \endcode
 * and optionally check its return value for TWI_SUCCESS.
 * \subsection twi_basic_use_case_usage_code_reading Example code : Reading from a slave device
 * Use in application C-file:
 * \code
 *   uint8_t data_received[10];
 * 
 *   twi_package_t packet_read = {
 *     .addr         = EEPROM_MEM_ADDR,      // TWI slave memory address data
 *     .addr_length  = sizeof (uint16_t),    // TWI slave memory address data size
 *     .chip         = EEPROM_BUS_ADDR,      // TWI slave bus address
 *     .buffer       = data_received,        // transfer data destination buffer
 *     .length       = 10                    // transfer data size (bytes)
 *   };
 *   // Perform a multi-byte read access then check the result.
 *   if(twi_master_read(&TWIM0, &packet_read) == TWI_SUCCESS){
 *     //Check read content
 *     if(data_received[0]==0x55)
 *       do_something();
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection twi_basic_use_case_usage_flow Workflow
 * -# Prepare a data buffer that will receive the data from the slave device:
 *   \code uint8_t data_received[10]; \endcode
 * -# Prepare a twi_package_t structure
 *   \code twi_package_t packet_read; \endcode 
 * Fill all the fields of the structure :
 *  - addr is the address in the slave device
 *  - addr_length is the size of the address in the slave (support for large TWI memory devices)
 *  - chip sets the 7 bit address of the slave device you want to communicate with 
 *  - buffer is a pointer on the data buffer that will receive the data from the slave device
 *  - length is the number of data to read
 *
 * -# Finally, call twi_master_read \code twi_master_read(&TWIM0, &packet_read); \endcode
 * and optionally check its return value for TWI_SUCCESS.
 * the data read from the device are now in data_received.

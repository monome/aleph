/**
 * \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use the reset cause interface.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 *  - reset_cause_example.c example application
 *
 * \section reset_cause_interface_section services/basic/cpu/reset_cause.h interface
 * The reset cause interface is described in the \ref reset_cause_group section.
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * All AVR devices can be used. This example has been tested with the following
 * setup:
 *  - Xplain evaluation kit
 *
 * \section example_description Description of the example
 * The example will set LEDs on the board depending on the reset cause. The
 * LEDs are wired to reset causes in the following order:
 *  - LED0: power-on-reset reset
 *  - LED1: on-chip debug system reset
 *  - LED2: JTAG reset
 *  - LED3: external reset
 *  - LED4: software reset
 *  - LED5: brown-out (on any power domains) detected reset
 *  - LED6: watchdog timeout reset
 *  - LED7: spike detection reset
 *
 * Where boards have less than the number of LEDs given above, the list is
 * shorted to the number of available LEDs.
 *
 * On boards with at least one button, the first available button will be used
 * to trigger a software reset when pressed.
 *
 * Users will observe different LEDs active depending if the device was reset
 * by toggling power, external reset input, reset triggered by programming and
 * debug tools and finally triggered by pressing the on-board button.
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * This example depends on the gpio.h interface.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.

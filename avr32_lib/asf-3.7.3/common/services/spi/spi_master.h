 * \section spi_group_platform Platform Dependencies
 *
 * The SPI API is partially chip- or platform-specific. While all
 * platforms provide mostly the same functionality, there are some
 * variations around how different bus types and clock tree structures
 * are handled.
 *
 * The following functions are available on all platforms, but there may
 * be variations in the function signature (i.e. parameters) and
 * behavior. These functions are typically called by platform-specific
 * parts of drivers, and applications that aren't intended to be
 * portable:
 *   - spi_master_init()
 *   - spi_master_setup_device()
 *   - spi_select_device()
 *   - spi_deselect_device()
 *   - spi_write_single()
 *   - spi_write_packet()
 *   - spi_read_single()
 *   - spi_read_packet()
 *   - spi_is_tx_empty()
 *   - spi_is_tx_ready()
 *   - spi_is_rx_full()
 *   - spi_is_rx_ready()

 *
 * This is the quick start guide for the \ref spi_group "SPI Driver", with
 * step-by-step instructions on how to configure and use the driver for a
 * specific use case.
 *
 * The use case contain several code fragments. The code fragments in the
 * steps for setup can be copied into a custom initialization function, while
 * the steps for usage can be copied into, e.g., the main application function.
 *
 * The steps for setting up the SPI master for XMEGA and UC3 use exactly the
 * same approach, but note that there are different names on the peripherals. So
 * to use this Quick Start for UC3 please make sure that all the peripheral
 * names are updated according to the UC3 datasheet.

/**
 * \page spi_master_xmega Basic setup for SPI master on XMEGA devices
 *
 * \section spi_master_xmega_basic Basic setup for XMEGA devices
 * The SPI module will be set up as master:
 *  - SPI on PORTD
 *  - 1MHz SPI clock speed
 *  - Slave Chip Select connected on PORTD pin 1
 *  - SPI mode 0 (data on rising clock edge)
 *
 * \section   spi_master_xmega_basic_setup Setup steps
 * \subsection spi_master_xmega_basic_setup_code Example code
 * Add to application C-file (e.g. main.c):
 * \code
 *   void spi_init_pins(void)
 *   {
 *       ioport_configure_port_pin(&PORTD, PIN1_bm, IOPORT_INIT_HIGH | IOPORT_DIR_OUTPUT);
 *
 *       ioport_configure_port_pin(&PORTD, PIN4_bm, IOPORT_PULL_UP | IOPORT_DIR_INPUT);
 *       ioport_configure_port_pin(&PORTD, PIN5_bm, IOPORT_INIT_HIGH | IOPORT_DIR_OUTPUT);
 *       ioport_configure_port_pin(&PORTD, PIN6_bm, IOPORT_DIR_INPUT);
 *       ioport_configure_port_pin(&PORTD, PIN7_bm, IOPORT_INIT_HIGH | IOPORT_DIR_OUTPUT);
 *   }
 *
 *   void spi_init_module(void)
 *   {
 *      struct spi_device spi_device_conf = {
 *          .id = IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTD, 1)
 *      };
 *
 *      spi_master_init(&SPID);
 *      spi_master_setup_device(&SPID, &spi_device_conf, SPI_MODE_0, 1000000, 0);
 *      spi_enable(&SPID);
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection spi_master_xmega_basic_setup Workflow
 * -# Ensure that \ref conf_spi_master.h is present for the driver.
 *  - \note This file is only for the driver and should not be included by the
 * user. In this example the file can be left empty.
 * -# Initialize the pins used by the SPI interface (this initialization is for
 * the ATxmega32A4U device).
 *  -# Set the pin used for slave select as output high:
 *    \code
 *    ioport_configure_port_pin(&PORTD, PIN1_bm, IOPORT_INIT_HIGH | IOPORT_DIR_OUTPUT);
 *    \endcode
 *  -# Enable pull-up on own chip select (SS):
 *    \code
 *    ioport_configure_port_pin(&PORTD, PIN4_bm, IOPORT_PULL_UP | IOPORT_DIR_INPUT);
 *    \endcode
 *    \attention If this pin is pulled low the SPI module will go into slave mode.
 *  -# Set MOSI and SCL as output high, and set MISO as input:
 *    \code
 *    ioport_configure_port_pin(&PORTD, PIN5_bm, IOPORT_INIT_HIGH | IOPORT_DIR_OUTPUT);
 *    ioport_configure_port_pin(&PORTD, PIN6_bm, IOPORT_DIR_INPUT);
 *    ioport_configure_port_pin(&PORTD, PIN7_bm, IOPORT_INIT_HIGH | IOPORT_DIR_OUTPUT);
 *    \endcode
 * -# Define the SPI device configuration struct to describe which pin the
 * slave select (slave chip select) is connected to, in this case the slave
 * select pin has been connected to PORTD pin 1 (PD1):
 *  - \code
 *   struct spi_device spi_device_conf = {
 *       .id = IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTD, 1)
 *   };
 * \endcode
 * -# Initialize the SPI module, in this case SPI on PORTD has been chosen:
 *  - \code
 *    spi_master_init(&SPID);
 *    \endcode
 * -# Setup the SPI master module for a specific device:
 *  - \code
 *   spi_master_setup_device(&SPID, &spi_device_conf, SPI_MODE_0, 1000000, 0);
 * \endcode
 *  - \note The last argument, which is zero in this case, can be ignored and is
 *  only included for compatibility purposes.
 * -# Then enable the SPI:
 *  - \code
 *    spi_enable(&SPID);
 *    \endcode
 *
 * \section spi_master_xmega_basic_usage Usage steps
 * \subsection spi_master_xmega_basic_usage_code Example code
 * Add to, e.g., the main loop in the application C-file:
 * \code
 *   uint8_t data_buffer[1] = {0xAA};
 *
 *   struct spi_device spi_device_conf = {
 *       .id = IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTD, 1)
 *   };
 *
 *   spi_select_device(&SPID, &spi_device_conf);
 *
 *   spi_write_packet(&SPID, data_buffer, 1);
 *   spi_read_packet(&SPID, data_buffer, 1);
 *
 *   spi_deselect_device(&SPID, &spi_device_conf);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection spi_master_xmega_basic_usage_flow Workflow
 * -# Create a buffer for data to be sent/received on the SPI bus, in this case
 * a single byte buffer is used. The buffer can be of arbitrary size as long as
 * there is space left in SRAM:
 *  - \code
 *    uint8_t data_buffer[1] = {0xAA};
 *    \endcode
 * -# Define the SPI device configuration struct to describe which pin the
 * slave select (slave chip select) is connected to, in this case the slave
 * select pin has been connected to PORTD pin 1 (PD1):
 *  - \code
 *   struct spi_device spi_device_conf = {
 *       .id = IOPORT_CREATE_PIN(PORTD, 1)
 *   };
 * \endcode
 *  - \note As this struct is the same for both the initializing part and the usage
 * part it could be a good idea to make the struct global, and hence accessible
 * for both the initializing part and usage part. Another solution could be to
 * create the struct in the main function and pass the address of the struct to
 * the spi_init_module() function, e.g.:
 *  \code
 *   void spi_init_module(struct spi_device *spi_device_conf)
 *   {
 *       ...
 *
 *       spi_master_setup_device(&SPID, spi_device_conf, SPI_MODE_0, 1000000, 0);
 *
 *       ...
 *   }
 * \endcode
 * -# Write data to the SPI slave device, in this case write one byte from the
 * data_buffer:
 *  - \code
 *   spi_write_packet(&SPID, data_buffer, 1);
 * \endcode
 * -# Read data from the SPI slave device, in this case read one byte and put it
 * into the data_buffer:
 *  - \code
 *   spi_read_packet(&SPID, data_buffer, 1);
 * \endcode
 *  - \attention As the SPI works as a shift register so that data is shifted in at
 * the same time as data is shifted out a read operation will mean that a dummy
 * byte \ref CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_DUMMY is written to the SPI bus. \ref CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_DUMMY
 * defaults to 0xFF, but can be changed by defining it inside the \ref conf_spi_master.h
 * file.
 * -# When read and write operations is done de-select the slave:
 *  - \code
 *   spi_deselect_device(&SPID, &spi_device_conf);
 * \endcode
 *

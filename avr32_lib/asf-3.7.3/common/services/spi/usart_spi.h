/**

 * \defgroup usart_spi_group USART in SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) mode
 *
 * This is the common API for USART in SPI mode. Additional features are available
 * in the documentation of the specific modules.
 *
 * \section spi_group_platform Platform Dependencies
 *
 * The spi API is partially chip- or platform-specific. While all
 * platforms provide mostly the same functionality, there are some
 * variations around how different bus types and clock tree structures
 * are handled.
 *
 * The following functions are available on all platforms, but there may
 * be variations in the function signature (i.e. parameters) and
 * behaviour. These functions are typically called by platform-specific
 * parts of drivers, and applications that aren't intended to be
 * portable:
 *   - usart_spi_init()
 *   - usart_spi_setup_device()
 *   - usart_spi_select_device()
 *   - usart_spi_deselect_device()
 *   - usart_spi_write_single()
 *   - usart_spi_write_packet()
 *   - usart_spi_read_single()
 *   - usart_spi_read_packet()
 *   - usart_spi_is_tx_empty()
 *   - usart_spi_is_tx_ready()
 *   - usart_spi_is_rx_full()
 *   - usart_spi_is_rx_ready()
 *   - usart_spi_enable()
 *   - usart_spi_disable()
 *   - usart_spi_is_enabled()

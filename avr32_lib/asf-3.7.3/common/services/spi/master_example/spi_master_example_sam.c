 * \mainpage spi_master_example_sam3
 *
 * \par intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use the SPI Master Mode Basic Services.
 * 
 * \par files Main Files
 * - spi_master_example_sam3.c: port drivers example application.
 * - conf_board.h: board initialization process configuration.
 * - conf_spi_master_example.h: board-specific mapping of resources used by this example.
 * - spi_master.c: Part Specific SPI Master Mode Implementation.
 *
 * \par spiapiinfo services/basic/spi API
 * The spi API can be found \ref spi_master.h "here".
 *
 * \par deviceinfo Device Info
 * SAM3N EK can be used because this EK has on-board SPI dataflash. 
 * This example has been tested with the following setup:
 *   - Evaluation kits with a dataflash connected through an SPI interface. 
 *   (This example works on SAM3N-EK.)
 *
 * \par exampledescription Description of the example
 *   - Send "Read Status" command to the dataflash.
 *   - Read back the status of the dataflash.
 *   - If status is "ok", both \ref SPI_EXAMPLE_LED_PIN_EXAMPLE_1 and \ref SPI_EXAMPLE_LED_PIN_EXAMPLE_2 are 'on',
 *     else \ref SPI_EXAMPLE_LED_PIN_EXAMPLE_1 is 'on' and \ref SPI_EXAMPLE_LED_PIN_EXAMPLE_2 is 'off'.
 *
 *
 * \par compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for ARM and SAM3.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.

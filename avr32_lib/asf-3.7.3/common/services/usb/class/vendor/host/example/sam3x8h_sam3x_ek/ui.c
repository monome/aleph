 * Human interface on SAM3X-EK :
 * - Led 3 (D5, red) is on when Vbus is generated
 * - Led 1 (D4, green) is continuously on when a device is connected
 * - Led 1 blinks when the device is enumerated and USB in idle mode
 *   - The blink is slow (1s) with low speed device
 *   - The blink is normal (0.5s) with full speed device
 *   - The blink is fast (0.25s) with high speed device
 * - Led 0 (D2, blue) is on when all vendor tests are success
 * - Led 0 blinks when a vendor test is unsuccess

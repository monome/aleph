 * Jumper setup on SAM4L_EK :

 * - Connect PB05 and usb (ID detect)
 * - Connect PC07 and usb (VBus error detect)
 * - Connect PC08 and usb (VBus control)
 *
 * Human interface on SAM4L_EK :
 * - Led 0 is on when it's host and there is no device connected
 * - Led 0 blinks when a device is enumerated and USB in idle mode
 *   - The blink is slow (1s) with low speed device
 *   - The blink is normal (0.5s) with full speed device
 *   - The blink is fast (0.25s) with high speed device
 * - Led 0 is on during data transfer between CDC and UART

/**
 * \defgroup UI User Interface
 *
 * Human interface on STK600:
 * - Led 0 is on when USB line is in IDLE mode, and off in SUSPEND mode
 * - Led 1 blinks when USB host has checked and enabled CDC interface
 * - Led 2 is on when CDC port is open
 * - Led 4 is on during data transfer from CDC to UART
 * - Led 5 is on during data transfer from UART to CDC
 * - Led 6 signals an frame error on UART
 * - Led 7 signals an overflow
 *
 * Setup of STK600:
 * - LEDS connector is connected to PORTE
 * - SWITCHES are connected to PORTF
 * - PC2 (RXC0) is connected to RS232 SPARE RXD
 * - PC3 (TXC0) is connected to RS232 SPARE TXD

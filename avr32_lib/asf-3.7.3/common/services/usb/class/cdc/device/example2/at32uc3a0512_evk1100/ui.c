/**
 * \defgroup UI User Interface
 *
 * Human interface on EVK1100:
 * - Led 0 is on when USB line is in IDLE mode, and off in SUSPEND mode
 * - Led 1 blinks when USB host has checked and enabled CDC interface
 * - Led 2 is on when the UART_0 is open by USB Host
 * - Led 3 is on when the UART_1 is open by USB Host
 * - Led 4 green is on during data transfer from CDC to UART
 * - Led 5 green is on during data transfer from UART to CDC
 * - Led 4 red means an frame error on UART
 * - Led 5 red means an overflow

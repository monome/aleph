/**
 * \mainpage ASF USB Device CDC
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to implement a USB Device CDC
 * on Atmel MCU with USB module.
 * The application note AVR4907 provides more information
 * about this implementation.
 *
 * \section desc Description of the Communication Device Class (CDC)
 * The Communication Device Class (CDC) is a general-purpose way to enable all
 * types of communications on the Universal Serial Bus (USB).
 * This class makes it possible to connect communication devices such as
 * digital telephones or analog modems, as well as networking devices
 * like ADSL or Cable modems.
 * While a CDC device enables the implementation of quite complex devices,
 * it can also be used as a very simple method for communication on the USB.
 * For example, a CDC device can appear as a virtual COM port, which greatly
 * simplifies application development on the host side.
 *
 * \section startup Startup
 * The example is a implementation of 7 USB CDC interface.
 *
 * In this example, we will use a PC as a USB host:
 * - Connect the application to a USB host (e.g. a PC)
 *   with a mini-B (embedded side) to A (PC host side) cable.
 * The application will behave as 7 virtual COM (see Windows Device Manager).
 * - Open a HyperTerminal on a virtual COM port
 * - Ignore virtual COM port configuration because this does not manage a
 *   true UART
 * - Type the character 'p' in the HyperTerminal and it will display the port
 *   number"PORTX" corresponding at virtual COM port opened.
 *
 * \note
 * On the first connection of the board on the PC,
 * the operating system will detect a new peripheral:
 * - This will open a new hardware installation window.
 * - Choose "No, not this time" to connect to Windows Update for this
 *   installation
 * - click "Next"
 * - When requested by Windows for a driver INF file, select the
 *   atmel_devices_cdc.inf file in the directory indicated in the Atmel Studio
 *   "Solution Explorer" window.
 * - click "Next"
 *
 * \copydoc UI
 *
 * \section example About example
 *
 * The example uses the following module groups:
 * - Basic modules:
 *   Startup, board, clock, interrupt, power management
 * - USB Device stack and CDC modules:
 *   <br>services/usb/
 *   <br>services/usb/udc/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/cdc/
 * - Specific implementation:
 *    - main.c,
 *      <br>initializes clock
 *      <br>initializes interrupt
 *      <br>manages UI
 *      <br>
 *    - specific implementation for each target "./examples/product_board/":
 *       - conf_foo.h   configuration of each module
 *       - ui.c        implement of user's interface (leds,buttons...)

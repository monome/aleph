/**
 * \mainpage ASF USB Device MSC
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to implement a USB Device Mass Storage
 * on Atmel MCU products with USB module.
 *
 * \section startup Startup
 * The example uses all memories available on the board and connects these to
 * USB Device Mass Storage stack. After loading firmware, connect hardware board
 * (EVKxx,Xplain,...) to the USB Host. When connected to a USB host system
 * this application allows to display all available memories as a
 * removable disks in the Unix/Mac/Windows operating systems.
 * \note
 * This example uses the native MSC driver on Unix/Mac/Windows OS, except for Win98.
 *
 * \copydoc UI
 *
 * \section example About example
 *
 * The example uses the following module groups:
 * - Basic modules:
 *   Startup, board, clock, interrupt, power management
 * - USB Device stack and MSC modules:
 *   <br>services/usb/
 *   <br>services/usb/udc/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/msc/
 * - Specific implementation:
 *    - main.c,
 *      <br>initializes clock
 *      <br>initializes interrupt
 *      <br>manages UI
 *    - specific implementation for each target "./examples/product_board/":
 *       - conf_foo.h   configuration of each module
 *       - ui.c        implement of user's interface (leds)
 *
 * \subsection freertos FreeRTOS
 * \paragraph tasks Task required
 * The USB device stack is fully interrupt driven and uses the USB DMA to transfer
 * data from/to the internal RAM. Thus, the USB does not require task creation.
 * However, the data memory transfer is done without DMA and requires a specific task
 * (called main_memories_trans_task).
 * 
 * \paragraph sync Task synchronization
 * The memory transfer task is synchronized (wakeup) by a mutex
 * (main_trans_semphr) which is given by a USB notification callback
 * (main_msc_notify_trans()). The callback is called by the USB interrupt which
 * is FreeRTOS compliant (See ISR_FREERTOS() macro).
 *
 * \paragraph power Sleep mode in FreeRTOS
 * The USB stack supports the sleepmgr module which allows to easily use the
 * CPU sleep mode and reduce the power consumption. To use sleepmgr modules 
 * in FreeRTOS, the best option is to enable configUSE_IDLE_HOOK and define
 * vApplicationIdleHook() which calls sleepmgr_enter_sleep().
 *
 * However, the IDLE sleep level must be locked in sleepmgr module, if you want
 * that FreeRTOS runs when USB cable is unplugged. In fact, the Timer counter
 * used by FreeRTOS runs only when sleep level is > IDLE.

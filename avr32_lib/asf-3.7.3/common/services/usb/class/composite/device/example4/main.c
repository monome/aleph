/**
 * \mainpage ASF USB Composite Device Example CDC and MSC
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to implement a USB Composite Device with CDC and
 * Mass Storage interfaces on Atmel MCU with USB module.
 *
 * \section desc Description of the Communication Device Class (CDC)
 * The Communication Device Class (CDC) is a general-purpose way to enable all
 * types of communications on the Universal Serial Bus (USB).
 * This class makes it possible to connect communication devices such as
 * digital telephones or analog modems, as well as networking devices
 * like ADSL or Cable modems.
 * While a CDC device enables the implementation of quite complex devices,
 * it can also be used as a very simple method for communication on the USB.
 * For example, a CDC device can appear as a virtual COM port, which greatly
 * simplifies application development on the host side.
 *
 * \section startup Startup
 * The example uses all memories available on the board and connects these to
 * USB Device Mass Storage stack.
 * Also, the example is a bridge between a USART from the main MCU
 * and the USB CDC interface.
 * After loading firmware, connect the board (EVKxx,Xplain,...) to the USB Host.
 * When connected to a USB host system this application allows to display
 * all available memories as a removable disks and provides a mouse, keyboard and CDC in
 * the Unix/Mac/Windows operating systems.
 *
 * In this example, we will use a PC as a USB host:
 * it connects to the USB and to the USART board connector.
 * - Connect the USART peripheral to the USART interface of the board.
 * - Connect the application to a USB host (e.g. a PC)
 *   with a mini-B (embedded side) to A (PC host side) cable.
 * The application will behave as a virtual COM (see Windows Device Manager).
 * - Open a HyperTerminal on both COM ports (RS232 and Virtual COM)
 * - Select the same configuration for both COM ports up to 115200 baud.
 * - Type a character in one HyperTerminal and it will echo in the other.
 *
 * \note
 * This example uses the native MSC driver on Unix/Mac/Windows OS, except for Win98.
 * About CDC, on the first connection of the board on the PC,
 * the operating system will detect a new peripheral:
 * - This will open a new hardware installation window.
 * - Choose "No, not this time" to connect to Windows Update for this installation
 * - click "Next"
 * - When requested by Windows for a driver INF file, select the
 *   atmel_devices_cdc.inf file in the directory indicated in the Atmel Studio
 *   "Solution Explorer" window.
 * - click "Next"
 *

 * \section example About example
 *
 * The example uses the following module groups:
 * - Basic modules:
 *   Startup, board, clock, interrupt, power management
 * - USB Device stack and CDC & MSC modules:
 *   <br>services/usb/
 *   <br>services/usb/udc/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/msc/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/cdc/
 * - Specific implementation:
 *    - main.c,
 *      <br>initializes clock
 *      <br>initializes interrupt
 *      <br>manages UI
 *    - udi_composite_desc.c,udi_composite_conf.h,
 *      <br>USB Composite Device definition
 *    - uart_uc3.c,
 *      <br>implementation of RS232 bridge for AVR32 parts
 *    - uart_xmega.c,
 *      <br>implementation of RS232 bridge for XMEGA parts
 *    - uart_sam.c,
 *      <br>implementation of RS232 bridge for SAM parts
 *    - specific implementation for each target "./examples/product_board/":
 *       - conf_foo.h   configuration of each module
 *       - ui.c        implement of user's interface (buttons, leds)
 *
 * <SUP>1</SUP> The memory data transfers are done outside USB interrupt routine.
 * This is done in the MSC process ("udi_msc_process_trans()") called by main loop.

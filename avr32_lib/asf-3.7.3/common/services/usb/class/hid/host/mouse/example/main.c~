/**
 * \mainpage ASF USB host HID mouse
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to implement a USB host HID mouse
 * on Atmel MCU with USB module.
 * The application note AVR4953 provides information about this implementation.
 *
 * \section startup Startup
 * After loading firmware, connect the board (EVKxx,Xplain,...) to a USB device mouse.
 *
 * \copydoc UI
 *
 * \section example About example
 *
 * The example uses the following module groups:
 * - Basic modules:
 *   Startup, board, clock, interrupt, power management
 * - USB host stack and HID modules:
 *   <br>services/usb/
 *   <br>services/usb/uhc/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/hid/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/hid/host/mouse/
 * - Specific implementation:
 *    - main.c,
 *      <br>initializes clock
 *      <br>initializes interrupt
 *      <br>manages UI
 *    - specific implementation for each target "./examples/product_board/":
 *       - conf_foo.h   configuration of each module
 *       - ui.c        implement of user's interface (buttons, leds)

/**
 * \mainpage ASF USB Device HID Generic
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to implement a USB Device HID Generic
 * on XMEGA-A3BU Xplained that uses QTouch key.
 * The application note AVR1632 provides information about this implementation.
 *
 * \section startup Startup
 * The example uses the buttons or sensors available on the board
 * to simulate a standard generic.
 * After loading firmware, connect the board to the USB Host.
 * When connected to a USB host system this application provides a HID generic
 * application in the Unix/Mac/Windows operating systems.
 * This example uses the native HID driver for these operating systems.
 *
 * A Atmel PC tool allows to communicate with the HID generic device.
 * This document gives information on integrating the Atmel USB HID DLL functions.
 * Simple code examples that demonstrate different types of implementation are given.
 * http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc7645.pdf
 * The PC tool is available here:
 * http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/AVR153.zip
 * Note: Use the PID 0x2402 in tool graphic interface,
 * and the button Firmware Upgrade only disconnects the USB device.
 *
 * \copydoc UI
 *
 * \section example About example
 *
 * The example uses the following module groups:
 * - Basic modules:
 *   Startup, board, clock, interrupt, power management
 * - USB Device stack and HID modules:
 *   <br>services/usb/
 *   <br>services/usb/udc/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/hid/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/hid/generic/
 * - Specific implementation:
 *    - main.c,
 *      <br>initializes clock
 *      <br>initializes interrupt
 *      <br>manages UI
 *    - touch.c
 *     <br>initializes touch
 *     <br>initializes timer to measure touch periodically
 *     <br>provides status of QTouch key
 *    - specific implementation for each target "./examples/product_board/":
 *       - conf_foo.h configuration of each module
 *       - ui.c       implement of user's interface (QTouch key, buttons, leds)

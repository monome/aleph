/**
 * \mainpage ASF USB host and device HID mouse
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to implement a USB dual mode (device and host)
 * HID Mouse on Atmel MCU with USB module.
 *
 * \section startup Startup
 * In device mode, the example uses the buttons or sensors available
 * on the board to simulate a standard mouse.
 * After loading firmware, connect the board to the USB Host.
 * When connected to a USB host system this application provides
 * a mouse application in the Unix/Mac/Windows operating systems.
 * This example uses the native HID driver for these operating systems.
 *
 * In host mode, after loading firmware, connect the board
 * to a USB device mouse.
 *
 * \copydoc UI
 *
 * \section example About example
 *
 * The example uses the following module groups:
 * - Basic modules:
 *   Startup, board, clock, interrupt, power management
 * - USB device and host stack and HID modules:
 *   <br>services/usb/
 *   <br>services/usb/udc/
 *   <br>services/usb/uhc/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/hid/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/hid/device/mouse/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/hid/host/mouse/
 * - Specific implementation:
 *    - main.c,
 *      <br>initializes clock
 *      <br>initializes interrupt
 *      <br>manages UI
 *    - specific implementation for each target "./examples/product_board/":
 *       - conf_foo.h   configuration of each module
 *       - ui.c        implement of user's interface (buttons, leds)

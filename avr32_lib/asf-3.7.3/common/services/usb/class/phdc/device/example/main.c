/**
 * \mainpage ASF USB Device PHDC
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to implement a USB Device PHDC
 * on Atmel MCU with USB module.
 * This example uses a IEEEE11073 stack skeleton which has the minimum to
 * pass USB Command Verifier 2.0 Tool (CV2.0) tests from usb.org.
 * Note: No USB driver is provided by Atmel for PHDC, but it is not required
 * to execute CV2.0 PHDC tests.
 *
 * \section startup Startup
 * You must compile, load and start example.
 * After, you can start CV2.0 and execute Chapter 9 and PHDC tests.
 *
 * \copydoc UI
 *
 * \section example About example
 *
 * The example uses the following module groups:
 * - Basic modules:
 *   Startup, board, clock, interrupt, power management
 * - USB Device stack and HID modules:
 *   <br>services/usb/
 *   <br>services/usb/udc/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/phdc/device/
 * - Specific implementation:
 *    - main.c,
 *      <br>initializes clock
 *      <br>initializes interrupt
 *      <br>manages UI
 *    - ieee11073_skeleton.c, IEEEE11073 stack skeleton
 *    - specific implementation for each target "./examples/product_board/":
 *       - conf_foo.h   configuration of each module
 *       - ui.c        implement of user's interface (buttons, leds)

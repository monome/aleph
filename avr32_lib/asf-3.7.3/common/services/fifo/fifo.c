 * \brief This file controls the software FIFO management.
 *
 * These functions manages FIFOs thanks to simple a API. The FIFO can
 * be 100% full thanks to a double-index range implementation. For example,
 * a FIFO of 4 elements can be implemented: the FIFO can really hold up to 4
 * elements.
 * This is particularly well suited for any kind of application needing a lot of
 * small FIFO.
